# ✨ The Reading Nook

The Reading Nook is a blog website created for a course assignment. 

The objective was to use at least four technologies and/or languages covered in class up to that point in time: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, databases. 

This simple blog was created from scratch in order to gain experience and understanding of each of the above topics covered.

### 🔧 Work in Progress
Currently experimenting with and working on improving my GitHub repos and their respective ReadMe files to become better at documenting  :)
